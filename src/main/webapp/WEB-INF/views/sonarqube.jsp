      <p>Back in 2007, when first lines of code were created, the founders of SonarQube (originally called Sonar) had a dream to one day provide every developer the ability to measure the code quality of his projects. Their motto: “Continuous Inspection must become mainstream as Continuous Integration”.</p>
